# AI-Powered Shopping Assistant for Personalized E-commerces

Build an AI Shopping Assistant to Personalize and Maximize Online E-commerce Sales with GPT-4V, Advanced RAG, LlamaIndex, and Deep Lake. Budget, Weather & Look Optimization.


## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Shopping Assistant is an innovative application that leverages state-of-the-art image processing and Large Language Model (LLM) 
agents to provide personalized outfit recommendations. By uploading a picture of a clothing item, such as a dress, users can receive tailored 
suggestions for accessories and shoes based on specific occasions like business meetings or themed parties. This assistant goes beyond simple 
suggestions, understanding the context and style to deliver a truly personalized shopping experience.


**Maximize online sales with the power of AI!** This project demonstrates a cutting-edge shopping assistant that leverages image processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and vector databases to deliver hyper-personalized outfit recommendations.

### Why This Matters:

In the competitive world of e-commerce, providing a personalized shopping experience is paramount. This project showcases how AI can be used to:

* **Boost Customer Engagement:** Offer tailored outfit suggestions that inspire purchases.
* **Increase Sales:** Drive conversions by presenting customers with products they'll love.
* **Enhance User Experience:**  Make online shopping intuitive, engaging, and enjoyable.

### Technology Stack:

This project harnesses the power of leading AI technologies:

* **GPT-4V:** Advanced image understanding and description generation.
* **LlamaIndex:** Streamlined LLM agent development and integration.
* **Deep Lake:**  Efficient storage and retrieval of item descriptions as vectors for similarity search.

### Development of Core Tools
This AI shopping assistant leverages an Agent-based framework, where specialized tools enable powerful functionality. Let's explore the two core tools:

**1. Query Retriever:**
Purpose: This tool acts as the bridge between user input and the DeepLake vector database.
Functionality:
* Takes a user's garment image and desired outfit components as input.
* Uses GPT-4V to generate descriptions of the items.
* Converts descriptions into vector embeddings.
* Queries DeepLake for similar items based on the embeddings.
* Returns the top matching results from DeepLake.

**2. Outfit Generator:**
Purpose: This tool leverages the LLM's fashion sense to create stylish and cohesive outfits.
Functionality:
* Receives the retrieved items from the Query Retriever.
* Considers user-specified criteria like occasion and style preferences.
* Leverages its knowledge of fashion principles to select complementary items.
* Presents the user with a curated selection of complete outfit options.


### System Integration and Initial Testing

### How it Works:

1. **Image Upload & Analysis:** Users upload an image of a garment (e.g., a dress). GPT-4V analyzes the image and generates detailed descriptions of the clothing item and potential accompanying pieces.

2. **DeepLake Vector Search:** The descriptions are used to query our DeepLake vector database. DeepLake efficiently retrieves the most relevant items from our inventory based on similarity to the user's garment and desired outfit components.

3. **LLM-Powered Outfit Creation:**  A LlamaIndex-powered LLM agent steps in, acting as a personal stylist. It analyzes the retrieved items, considering factors like style, occasion (specified by the user), and current trends to curate cohesive outfit options.

4. **Personalized Recommendations:** The AI assistant presents the user with personalized outfit suggestions, complete with product IDs (easily converted to retailer URLs) and price comparisons for a seamless shopping experience. 

### Architecture Highlights:

* **Agent-Based Framework:** The system employs an LLM agent equipped with specialized tools for vector database access, outfit generation, and more. This allows for modularity and dynamic interaction between components.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** The application boasts a user-friendly interface With Gradio that makes the AI's decision-making process transparent, providing valuable insights into how vector databases and LLMs work in practice.

### Project Benefits:

* **Real-World Application of AI:**  Gain hands-on experience building a sophisticated AI system with real-world e-commerce applications.
* **Deep Dive into DeepLake and LlamaIndex:** Master the use of DeepLake for efficient vector similarity search and LlamaIndex for building powerful LLM agents.
* **Inspiration for Innovation:**  Explore the cutting edge of AI-driven personalization and discover new ways to leverage these technologies in your own projects.

**This project is an exciting journey into the future of AI-powered shopping!**
